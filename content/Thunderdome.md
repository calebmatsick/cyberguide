This is a guide for the virtual cyber Thunderdome, located in the Center for Cyber Excellence in the School of Business.

The Thunderdome is simply a contained practice pentesting environment for students to build and develop their offensive security skills. 

## Getting Started

To get started with the Thunderdome, first connect to the Thunderdome WiFi network.  You should be within range of the network when in the Center for Cyber Excellence.  You may be able to access it from elsewhere in the School of Business, but this is not a guarantee.

The password for the network is simply ```Welcometothethunderdome```

You will have access to the internet when on this network.

## Rules

When on the Thunderdome, the following rules apply:

    1.  Do not attack any other students or devices.  Your scope is limited to the 192.168.20.0/24 subnet.
    2.  Do not break a machine intentionally.  
    3.  If you do accidentally break something, let an officer in the discord know, so they can reset the box for you.

You are allowed to fight with other people in a box; the Thunderdome is meant to be a cyber PvP zone.  Just ensure all activity happens on the boxes in scope.

## Machines

Below is a current list of the machines on the Thunderdome.  The boxes are from [vulnhub](https://vulnhub.com) and many have guides already written for them.  Feel free to utilize any resources you can find on the internet including these walkthrough guides.
