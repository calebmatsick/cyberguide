### About Us

We are the Liberty Cyber Defense Club.  We are a group of computer science students who have a passion for cyber security and educating others.  The club has a long history of helping students to learn and expand their skillsets in and out of the classroom.  Ultimately, the club is a community of like minded people who are all interested in cyber security in some way.
