## What is Kali Linux?

[Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) is the premier hacking linux distro maintained by [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/). Basically it an Ubuntu-based operating system with a currated collection of
software packages for ethical hacking, pentesting, and all the subgroups of operations therein.

## Alternatives

Now, technically you could run pretty much any linux distro, for you cybery activities, but Kali makes it easy have done (most) of the hard work in collecting all the hacking tools you might need. That said, you will most likely want to add or develop your own in the future!

However, Kali isn't the only Kid on the block. Deep in the dark recesses of the *nix world lies a quiet, but powerful underdog named BlackArch. If you're going for a Mr. Robot vibe, checking out [BlackArch](https://blackarch.org/) (in fact, installing arch linux in general!) will definately give you some extra street cred.

## Being Responsible

What you are about to learn is serious business. You'll be given tools used by real world professionals. Like most powerful tools, they can be used for evil. As a rule, when you are using cyber tools, **make sure you are only operating, on, with, or against systems and networks that you are authorized on.**

Make sure you understand what you are doing before you do it. Most of the time, on your own system, you should just try thing, press the wrong buttons, and learn. But for everything else, make sure you know what you are doing, and respect the law and other people. Federal prison is not fun, and a skript kiddie move that gets you picked up the FBI will ruin a lot of things, your career and reputation being the least of them.

## Installing Kali
