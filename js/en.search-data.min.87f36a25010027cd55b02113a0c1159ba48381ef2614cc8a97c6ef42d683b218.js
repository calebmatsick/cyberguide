Alternatives Being Responsible Installing Kali     What is Kali Linux? Kali Linux is the premier hacking linux distro maintained by Offensive Security. Basically it is a Ubuntu-based operating system that offers a number of Graphical desktop environments and currated collections of software packages for ethical hacking, pentesting, and all the subgroups of operations therein.\nAlternatives Now, technically you could run pretty much any linux distro for your cybery activities, but Kali makes it easy with (most) of the hard work of collecting all the cybersecurity tools for you. That said, there are plenty of other you\u0026rsquo;ll want to install eventually and even write your own!\nHowever, Kali isn\u0026rsquo;t the only Kid on the block. Deep in the dark recesses of the *nix world lies a quiet, but powerful underdog named BlackArch. If you\u0026rsquo;re going for a Mr. Robot vibe, checking out BlackArch (in fact, installing arch linux!) will definately give you some extra street cred.\nBeing Responsible What you are about to learn is serious business. You will be given tools used by real world professionals. Like most powerful tools, they can be used for good or evil. As a rule, when you are using cyber tools, make sure you are only operating, on, with, or against systems and networks that you are authorized on.\nMake sure you understand what you are doing before you do it. Most of the time, on your own system, you should just try things, press the wrong buttons and learn. But for everything else, make sure you know what you are doing, and respect the law and other people. Federal prison is not fun, and a skript kiddie move that gets you picked up the FBI will ruin a lot of things, your career and integrity being the least of them.\nInstalling Kali See Installing Kali for more details.\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/Beginner-Guide/Linux/','title':"Linux",'content':"What is Linux? Linux is an open-source operating system that is essential to know about in the cybersecurity world.
